\title{Viterbi Algorithm for Symmetric Continuous-time HMM (Rcpp)}
\usage{
ctmcViterbi(ts, theta, obs)
}
\arguments{
\item{ts}{size m positive float values characterize the timestamps for the observations}

\item{theta}{a single float value as the tansition parameter determining the transition probabilities}

\item{obs}{size n*m matrix containing all the conditional probabilities for each observation given each state at that timestamp.}
}
\value{
vector of Viterbi path representing the most likely state at each timestamp with observation
}
\description{
This function implements a Viterbi algorithm for the continuous-time Hidden Markov Model in a specific condition: n uniform initial states and a special-case dual transition probabilities related to the timestamp and parameter theta (detailed formula in the pdf instruction). The input arguments include the timestamps of each observation represented in a row with size m, a transition parameter theta used for the definition of the transition probabilities, a matrix containing all the conditional probabilities for each observation given each state at that timestamp. Note the time complexity is O(mn).

obs <- matrix(c(0.88,0.10,0.88,0.10,0.02,0.30,0.02,0.30,0.10,0.60),2,5)
theta <- log(2)
ts <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
